What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?

1. X will always be a better choice for all inputs
2. X will always be a better choice for large inputs
3. X will always be a better choice for small inputs
4. Y will always be a better choice for small inputs

<b> Ans - </b> X will always be a better choice for large inputs

In asymptotic analysis we consider growth of algorithm in terms of input size.An algorithm X
is said to be asymptotically better than Y if X takes smaller time than y for all input sizes n
larger than a value n0 where n0 > 0.
