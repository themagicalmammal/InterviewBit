'''

Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Example :

Input : \[1, 10, 5\]
Output : 5
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

You may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
You may also assume that the difference will not overflow.

class Solution:
def maximumGap(self, A):
A = sorted(A)
m = 0
for j in range(len(A) - 1):
m = max(m, A\[j + 1\] - A\[j\])
return m
